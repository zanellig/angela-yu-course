    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <h4>
      I am interested in learning more about programming, as I find it fun to
      solve problems and see the result of what I have learned in a functional
      project. I enjoy composing music and going to the gym, as well as
      eventually visiting new places with friends and family.
